## Boundaries

- The engine creates exactly one item result per request.
- `normalize()`, `validate()`, `generate()`, and the embedded editor use the same canonical request hydration path.
- The editor edits one request and previews one result. It does not create Foundry documents.
- The application container owns persistence/workflow actions such as `Item.create()`.
- Other modules should use the public engine API and may embed `ItemForgeEditor` without the standalone Item Forge window.
- Future Loot Forge integration should distribute budgets/counts/themes and issue individual Item Forge requests.
- Built-in and external treasure content use the same validated registries.
- Spell documents are support data, not directly generatable physical items. `ScrollGenerator` and `WandGenerator` may select eligible spells and embed them into physical item results; `StaffGenerator` uses the spell index to build a structured thematic staff manifest.

## Generator resolution

Generators are registered with a declared generation mode and priority. Resolution is deterministic: the highest-priority generator whose `supports(request)` returns true wins. This lets specialist and extension generators override broad core strategies without depending on registration order.

Core priorities:

```text
WandGenerator         220  mode magic
StaffGenerator        210  mode magic
TreasureGenerator     200  mode treasure
ScrollGenerator       200  mode existing
EquipmentGenerator    150  mode equipment
ExistingItemGenerator   0  mode existing
```

Registered generation modes are exposed through the public capabilities API and are validated dynamically rather than being hard-coded in the request normalizer.


## Spell-bound permanent magic items

`mode: "magic"` currently owns two generated categories: `magic.wand` and `magic.staff`. Both reuse the same spell-support index and the same meaningful-heightening helper used by scroll generation. Magic themes are data-driven filters/weighting hints rather than hard-coded spell lists.

### Wands

`WandGenerator` selects one eligible non-cantrip, non-focus, non-ritual spell from the configured spell sources. The spell rank must correspond to a legal base rank or to heightening data actually present on the spell when `magic.allowHeightened` is enabled. The generator resolves the PF2e generic wand template for that rank, clones it, transfers rarity/traits, and embeds the selected spell into `system.spell` with the chosen `heightenedLevel`. The physical wand level and price therefore come from PF2e's own rank-specific wand templates.

### Staves

`StaffGenerator` builds one thematic custom staff around an ordinary PF2e staff weapon source. A level profile determines the highest spell rank and generated sale price. The generator attempts to include one cantrip and spell entries from rank 1 through the profile maximum, with extra density near the top ranks. Previously chosen spells may reappear at a higher rank only when the indexed spell heightening data supports that rank.

Generated staff spell lists are stored twice: as enriched `@UUID` spell links in the item description for immediate Foundry usability, and as a complete structured manifest in `flags.pf2e-item-forge.staff` for deterministic regeneration and future integrations. The current implementation deliberately does not invent an undocumented PF2e-native custom-staff storage schema; native staff-preparation/casting automation can be wired to the structured manifest once its live-system contract is verified.

## Treasure generation

`TreasureGenerator` is implemented and data-driven. A request may choose a broad category such as `treasure.jewelry` or additionally pin one concrete registry type such as `core.type.jewelry.tiara`.

```text
Treasure request
   |
   +-- category + optional exact type
   +-- value target/range + bounded ValueSolver
   +-- material / condition / craftsmanship / motif / style
   |
   v
style-aware candidate construction
   |
   +-- type
   +-- material
   +-- condition
   +-- craftsmanship
   +-- motif
   +-- attributes
   +-- coherent optional components
   |
   v
valuation -> PF2e treasure Item source
```

Styles can weight material tags, motifs, craftsmanship, type tags, component chances, and condition profiles. Individual treasure types may additionally weight condition, craftsmanship, and motif choices, so books can age differently from metal jewelry and ceremonial objects can prefer different visual language from merchant luxury goods. Component craftsmanship can inherit the parent quality, stay close to it, roll independently, or be disabled. Gemstone materials may define their own `componentValue` range for inlays/settings.

Candidate construction is mildly target-aware: treasure type, material, workmanship, and optional component density are biased toward combinations that are more plausible for the requested sale value, while the bounded `ValueSolver` remains the final authority and all random choices remain seed-reproducible. Generated treasure keeps a full valuation breakdown and generation plan in `flags.pf2e-item-forge`.

Treasure types may also define a physical Bulk value. Book and beverage types use the generic attribute mechanism for details such as edition/completeness and origin/quality/vessel/age; these attributes contribute to valuation and are exposed in preview metadata.

Treasure registry definitions are validated when registered. Invalid ranges, missing component references, invalid fixed materials, malformed weights, and (when the CategoryRegistry is supplied) unknown categories fail immediately instead of surfacing during a later generation.

## Scroll generation

`ScrollGenerator` owns `mode: "existing"` + `category: "consumable.scroll"` before the general existing-item strategy resolves.

```text
Scroll request
   |
   +-- selected spell compendiums
   |      -> eligible non-cantrip/non-focus/non-ritual spells
   |
   +-- meaningful base/heightened ranks
   |      -> interval or fixed heightening definitions
   |
   +-- PF2e generic scroll template for that rank
   |      -> determines physical scroll level/price
   |
   v
physical Consumable source with embedded system.spell
```

Generic scroll templates are infrastructure and are suppressed from ordinary predefined-item selection so an empty scroll cannot leak into broad `item` or `consumable` generation.
